## Stories:

- As a user, I want the ability to load the full list of SpaceX launches from the SpaceX API
- As a user, I want the ability to reload the data to see any new changes
- As a user, I want the ability to filter the launch list by year
- As a user, I want the ability to sort all launches by date (ascending/descending)

## Considerations we will be looking for in your submission are:

- Project approach
- Accuracy of designs (within reason as they are not catered for mobile)
- State management (Redux / Context etc...)
- Code quality (e.g patterns and organization of the application code)
- Network logic
- File structure

## Bonus Considerations:

- Type Safety i.e TypeScript
- Unit Tests
- Accessibility considerations

## Setup Instructions

- Clone the project
- Install the necessary dependancies 'npm install'
- Run 'npm start' to start the application


## Run IOS

 - Run 'npm run ios'

## Run Android

 - Run 'npm run android'
